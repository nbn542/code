/*Stream:
A stream is a sequence of bytes. It acts as source from which the input data can be obtained or
as a destination to which the output data can be sent.
1. InputStream
Input Streams are used to hold input from a data producer, such as a keyboard, a 
file, or a network. The source stream that provides data to the program is called the input stream
2. OutputStream
Output Streams are used to hold output for a particular data consumer, such as a 
monitor, a file, or a printer. The destination stream that receives data from the 
program is called the output stream. 
ofstream:
 This data type represents the output file stream and is used to create files 
and to write information to files.
ifstream 
This data type represents the input file stream and is used to read 
information from files.
Opening a File
• A file must be opened before you can read from it or write toit.
Closing a File
• When a C++ program terminates it automatically closes flushes all the streams, 
release all the allocated memory and close all the openedfile
Writing to a File
• While doing C++ programming, you write information to a file from your program 
using the stream insertion operator (<<) just as you use that operator to output 
information to the screen
Reading from a File
• You read information from a file into your program using the stream extraction 
operator (>>) just as you use that operator to input information from the
keyboard.
Algorithm:
1. Start
2. Create aclass
3. Define data members roll number andname.
4.Define accept() to take name and roll number fromuser.
5. Define display() to display therecord.
6. In main() create the object of class and fstream class.
7.Take a limit from user in nvariable.
8. Open the file in out mode , call accept() to take record from user,then call write() to write 
that record into the file and at the end close that file.
9. Open the file in in mode, read the record from the file ,call display() function to display 
the record and at the end close that file.
10. Stop*/
